    description: "I am a highly motivated individual with a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering with Honors from Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA), currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the same institute. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in aerospace engineering and a comprehensive understanding of computer science. My technical expertise extends to web development, where I focus on JavaScript (TypeScript, React, React Native, Node), Python (Flask, Django), and other frameworks such as Laravel and Flutter. During my professional experience as a Freelancer at Hastings Informática, I developed proficiency in Python, Selenium, Django, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Docker, and Azure Git, enhancing my skills in web scraping and data extraction. As a Collaborating Researcher at Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica, I contributed to user experience modeling using Laravel and PostgreSQL, showcasing my versatility in front-end development. Additionally, my role as a Developer at Quero Educação and ITA Júnior, among other positions, has provided me with extensive experience in application development, interface design, and training. With a solid background in aerospace engineering and a focus on computer science, I am well-equipped for opportunities in the IT market, particularly in web development, where I bring a wealth of practical skills and a commitment to delivering innovative solutions.",
